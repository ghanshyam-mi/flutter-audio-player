# flutter_audio_list


- Take one recyclerview having an audio(song) list. (take at least 15 audios) (can use local audio or audio URLs)
- In the row file, give the option to play/pause the audio.
- At a time, it should play only one audio.

- When an app is in the background, it must continue playback.
- In the row file of audio, provide one full-width background view with some light colour by default, as audio playback continues, show itâ€™s progress in a background of that row by gradually filling its background with dark colour.
- When you play the audio which was paused before, it should resume from that time(progress) only for the session.
